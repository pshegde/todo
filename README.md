# todo

This is an android app built using the [codepath tutorial] (http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_android/prework)<br>


User stories implemented are: <br>
Successfully add and remove items from the todo list<br>
Support for editing todo items <br>
Persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart<br>
Persist to sqlite<br>
Add a custom adapter<br>
Display priorities<br>
Should show error message if empty text<br>
Add a dialog and spinner to allow user to select priority<br>
In exit text user should be able to edit the priority<br>

I am still working on additional features and will update them here once they are complete.
